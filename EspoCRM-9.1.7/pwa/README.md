## üèó Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Vue.js 3**: Modern reactive framework
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and dev server
- **PWA Plugin**: Service worker and manifest generation
- **Axios**: HTTP client for API communication

### Key Components
- `src/App.vue`: Main application shell
- `src/services/auth.js`: Authentication service
- `src/services/api.js`: EspoCRM API integration
- `src/services/notifications.js`: Push notification handling
- `src/components/CallPopup.vue`: After-call logging interface

### API Integration
- **REST API**: Connects to EspoCRM's built-in REST API
- **Authentication**: Token-based auth with secure storage
- **Real-time Sync**: Periodic data refresh
- **Offline Caching**: Service worker caches API responses

## üîß Configuration

### API Endpoints
The PWA automatically detects the EspoCRM API at `/api/v1/`. No configuration needed.

### Notification Settings
```javascript
// Customize notification timing in src/services/notifications.js
const reminderTime = new Date(eventTime.getTime() - 15 * 60 * 1000); // 15 minutes
```

### Call Integration
```javascript
// Configure call outcomes in src/components/CallPopup.vue
const callStatuses = ['Answered', 'Not Answered', 'Busy', 'Voicemail'];
```

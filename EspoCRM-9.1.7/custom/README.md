# Real Estate Management System for EspoCRM

This custom module implements a comprehensive real estate project and property unit management system for EspoCRM 9.1.7.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Custom Entities

#### CProject
- **Name** (required)
- **Location** (text)
- **Description** (text area)
- **Status** (Active/Inactive)
- Standard EspoCRM fields (created/modified by/at, assigned user, teams)

#### CPropertyUnit
- **Unit Number** (required)
- **Status** (enum): Available, Shortlisted, Hold, Token Received, Booked, Cancelled
- **Hold Expiry Date** (date) - required when status is Hold
- **Project** (Link to CProject)
- **Hold Opportunity** (link to Opportunity â€“ only one allowed)
- **Shortlisted Opportunities** (many-to-many link with Opportunity)
- **Token Date** (date) - auto-set when status changes to Token Received
- **Booking Date** (date) - auto-set when status changes to Booked
- Standard EspoCRM fields

### 2. Relationships
- One Project has many Property Units
- One Property Unit can be shortlisted by multiple Opportunities
- One Property Unit can be on hold by only one Opportunity

### 3. Status Logic
- **Default status** = Available
- **Shortlist**: Multiple clients (opportunities) can shortlist a unit
- **Hold**: Only one client can hold a unit at a time. When putting on hold, user must set "Hold Expiry Date" (defaults to 10 days)
- **Token Received and Booked**: Once a unit is in these statuses, only users with "Admin" role can change status back to Available
- **Cancelled**: Can only be moved back to Available by Admin

### 4. CSV Import
- Ability to import Property Units from a CSV file
- Template provided in `/custom/Espo/Custom/Resources/templates/import/CPropertyUnit.csv`
- Fields: Unit Number, Project Name, Status, Hold Expiry Date, Token Date, Booking Date, Assigned User

### 5. User Interface and Layouts
- **Detail, Edit, List views** for both entities
- **Related panels**:
  - In Project: show linked Units
  - In Opportunity: show shortlisted and held Units
- **Status dropdown** controlled with logic and permission checks in backend
- **Dynamic field visibility** based on status selection
- **Project Report Dashboard** with charts and statistics

### 6. Reporting Support
- Ability to filter units per project by status: Available, Booked, Cancelled
- Hold expiry tracking via date filter
- Visual project report with charts showing unit status distribution
- API endpoints for custom reporting

### 7. Automated Features
- **Automatic Hold Expiry Processing**: Scheduled job runs daily at 2 AM to process expired holds
- **Manual Expired Holds Processing**: Admin can manually trigger processing
- **Auto-date Setting**: Token Date and Booking Date are automatically set when status changes

## Installation

1. Deploy all files to the EspoCRM directory structure
2. Clear cache: `php command.php app-clear-cache`
3. Rebuild: `php command.php app-rebuild`
